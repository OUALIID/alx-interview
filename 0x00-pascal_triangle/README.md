<h2>What is Pascal&#39;s Triangle?</h2>
<p>Pascal&#39;s Triangle is a fascinating mathematical pattern named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is an infinite triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single &quot;1&quot; at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by summing the two adjacent numbers in the row above.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Structure</h2>
<p>Consider the first few rows of Pascal&#39;s Triangle:</p>
<pre><code>      1
     1 1
    1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
  1 4 6 4 1
</code></pre>
<p>Each number in the triangle is formed by adding the two numbers directly above it. For example, the &quot;3&quot; in the fourth row is the sum of the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;1&quot; above it.</p>

<h2>Python Implementation</h2>
<p>Your Python script <code>0-pascal_triangle.py</code> generates Pascal&#39;s Triangle up to a specified number of rows (<code>n</code>). Here&#39;s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>List Initialization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A list <code>triangle</code> is initialized to store the rows of Pascal&#39;s Triangle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Row Generation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A loop generates each row, with each row represented as a list initialized with &quot;1&quot;s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Value Calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Another loop updates the values in the triangle according to the rule: <code>triangle[line][i] = triangle[line - 1][i - 1] + triangle[line - 1][i]</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The final Pascal&#39;s Triangle, represented as a list of lists, is returned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visualizing the Result</h2>
<p>The <code>0-main.py</code> script utilizes a function <code>print_triangle</code> to print the generated Pascal&#39;s Triangle in a readable format. It formats and prints each row as a list.</p>
<h3>Example Output:</h3>
<pre><code>[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 3, 1]
[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers in each row are calculated based on the sum of the two numbers directly above them.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>To generate and visualize Pascal&#39;s Triangle, run the <code>0-main.py</code> script with the desired number of rows. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./0-main.py
</code></pre>
<p>This will showcase the beauty of Pascal&#39;s Triangle, where each number emerges from the sum of its predecessors.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical marvel that forms an infinite triangular array of numbers. Starting with a single "1" at the top, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle showcases the coefficients of the binomial expansion and reveals fascinating number patterns. It finds applications in probability, combinatorics, and algebra. Generating Pascal's Triangle in Python, as demonstrated in the code, provides a visual representation of this intriguing mathematical structure. Explore its beauty to uncover the symmetrical and additive nature of the numbers, fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical relationships.</p>
